As computer engineering students at Cairo University we thought it would be valuable to create an online platform that takes the form of software documentation as a guide for those that are considering enrolling, have enrolled or even have graduated form the department! 


**Thereby, the following are the motivations of this website:**

✦ Provide prospective students all the information they need to make an informed decision regarding 
whether or not to choose computer engineering

✦ Guide students that have just entered the department on how to cope and get ready for what's next. Some sections of the website will be even useful to graduate students!

✦ Realize the fact, that we are all one family; and that we are all ready to help one another no matter how far we are from each other.

## 🚆 Navigating the Website

It should be self-evident from the side bar; however, here is a small guide:

| Student Type         | Consideration                                   |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Prospective Students | Review the "Before Joining" section in the sidebar. If you have any unanswered questions, please create a GitHub issue. |
| Recent Students      | Consider the "Recently Joined" section.         |
| All Other Students   | Consider all mentioned sections and feel free to collaborate! |

**Important Note I**: The website is build to be updated continually; thus, checking it frequently for updates or changes is key.

**Important Note II**: The website is built with Arabic in mind. However, with this being initially written in English it may take some time until the Arabic versions of all pages are available. Collaboration here would be really helpful.


## 🪂 We are all Contributors!

Despite being initiated by one student, the represenative of the senior class, Essam W. The website is built with collaboration in mind. In particular, as a student part of the department, you are welcome to change any part of the content found within the website with zero web development coding prerequisites. 

✦ Modifying any existing page takes only modifying its corresponding markdown or json file. The page is represented by json only if contains a grid; otherwise, it's markdown. This all gets transpiled to html and css under the hood.

✦ You can even modify the sidebar to include more sections and pages and guess what! The side bar is a single yaml file.

**Hint I:** it takes approximately 2, 3 minutes to learn the structure of each of json and yaml respectively and another 5 minutes for markdown. These are textual formats any experienced developer is used to. 

**Hint II:** All files correpsonding to the website can be found inside "public/department". They follow the same hierarchy as the sidebar.

Once you're done. Simply submit a PR; it would be nice if you start proposing the PR as an issue if it's a big change.
