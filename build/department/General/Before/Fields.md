# üßë‚Äçüíª Computer Engineering Fields
We can roughly divide computer engineering, as taught in the department at Cairo university, into software engineering, machine learning & AI, embedded systems and digital design (hardware), cyber security and networks.

The following is a breakdown of what each of these involve:

| Field | Working Areas |
| --- | --- |
| Software Engineering | Web, Mobile, Desktop App Development, Game Development, Operating Systems |
| Machine Learning & AI | Data Science, Classical Machine Learning, Deep Learning (Research + Math) |
| Embedded Systems & Digital Design | Arduino, ARM, VHDL, Verilog, etc. |
| Cyber Security & Networks | Security and Networking Protocols and Algorithms (Some Math) |


The rest of this article will be devoted to explaining what each of these is about.
