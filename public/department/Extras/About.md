# üßÅ About CMP Docs

As computer engineering students at Cairo University we thought it would be valuable to create an online platform that takes the form of software documentation as a guide for those that are considering enrolling, have enrolled or even have graduated form the department! 


**Thereby, the following are the motivations of this website:**

‚ú¶ Provide prospective students all the information they need to make an informed decision regarding 
whether or not to choose computer engineering

‚ú¶ Guide students that have just entered the department on how to cope and get ready for what's next. Some sections of the website will be even useful to graduate students!

‚ú¶ Realize the fact, that we are all one family; and that we are all ready to help one another no matter how far we are from each other.

## üöÜ Navigating the Website

It should be self-evident from the side bar; however, here is a small guide:

| Student Type         | Consideration                                   |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Prospective Students | Review the "Before Joining" section in the sidebar. If you have any unanswered questions, please create a GitHub issue. |
| Recent Students      | Consider the "Recently Joined" section.         |
| All Other Students   | Consider all mentioned sections and feel free to collaborate! |

**Important Note I**: The website is build to be updated continually; thus, checking it frequently for updates or changes is key.

**Important Note II**: The website is built with Arabic in mind. However, with this being initially written in English it may take some time until the Arabic versions of all pages are available. Collaboration here would be really helpful.


## ü™Ç We are all Contributors!

The website is built with collaboration in mind. In particular, as a student part of the department, you are welcome to change any part of the content found within the website with zero web development coding prerequisites. 

‚ú¶ Modifying any existing page takes only modifying its corresponding markdown or yaml file. A page in the documentation is represented by yaml (which also supports markdown in strings) only if it contains a grid of icons; otherwise, it's pure markdown. This all gets transpiled to html and css under the hood.

‚ú¶ You can even modify the sidebar to include new sections and pages and guess what! The side bar is a single yaml file.

**Hint I:** It should only take you 10 minutes to get the hang of markdown or yaml syntax, assuming the unlikely coincidence that you don't know about them.

**Hint II:** All files correpsonding to the website can be found inside "public/department". They follow the same hierarchy as the sidebar.

To run for the first time, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) then type at the terminal

*npm install*

Now you can test any changes you perform by running

*npm start*


Once you're done. Simply submit a PR; it would be nice if you start proposing the PR as an issue if it's a big change.

#### Collaboration Notes

I. Please only write facts that you certainly sure of; if it's controversial please discuss in an issue first. It's best to either naturally deduce your argument or use references rather than just stating facts as if they were universal truisims.

II. Using gifs or emojis is highly recommended to keep the site lively
