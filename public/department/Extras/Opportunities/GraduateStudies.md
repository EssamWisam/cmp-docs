But before we do this, let's motivate you to pursue graduate studies.

![image](https://i.gifer.com/2PHb.gif)

## ‚≠ê Motivation

There are a couple of reasons why it may be a great idea for you to pursue graduate studies via one of the options mentioned above.

### 1. Make Solid Contributions in your Favorite Field

Graduate studies offer an opportunity to acquire in-depth knowledge and solve unanswered questions. Have you ever hoped to make a great positive impact in our world? Advancements in technology (e.g., ChatGPT) are in general a result of collaborative research which is exactly what you can get trained to do in graduate studies.

### 2. Stand Out from the Rest of the Workforce

Computer science jobs nowadays are highly competitive. We can categorize such jobs into four categories: (i), jobs were at least MS degree is required; (ii), jobs were it's explicitly mentioned that at least MS degree is preferred; (iii), jobs were it's not explicitly mentioned that MS degree is preferred but where it actually gives applicant an advantage by logic; and (iv), jobs where at least having a MS degree makes no difference.

We argue that most jobs are of types (i), (ii) and (iii). We further argue that jobs of type (iv), if they exist, will likely involve a poor learning curve. There are statistics available showing that jobs are moving more towards types (i) or (ii).

In general this also depends on the field. For instance, **machine learning** jobs tend to be much more likely in (i) (or at least (ii)) than other fields of computer science. This is because, unlike other fields, it's a field where theory and practice are much more strongly bound to each other. It could be also shown, that in the majority* of the cases for jobs abroad, applicants holding at least an MS degree often exceed those holding a BS degree in fields like machine learning.

### 3. Reach Senior Positions More Easily & Boost Income
You will find that senior and management positions tend to be more of types (i) and (ii). This is rational because such advanced degrees imply deeper knowledge and understanding (and hence, a better ability to manage and mentor others and work on more complex tasks). It also follows that you can find (global or foreign) statistics that demonstrate considerable gains in income for MS/PhD holders as opposed to BS holders.

### 4. It Aligns With (or Enhances) Your Skills
Do you have a thirst to dive deeper and understand more? A desire to continuously learn? Do you find pleasure in solving problems and experimenting? How about writing and explaining concepts? Do you appreciate collaboration with others?

If you answered "yes" to these, or at least "no" while being open to a "yes" in the future as such skills are enhanced, then it will likely and logically be naturally fulfilling for you to pursue graduate studies.

### 5. Networking Opportunities
You get the chance to meet other advanced students and professors which can open up opportunities for you. We know for sure that you truly miss the ability to be in an academic society as in your Bachelors; this is an opportunity to get back to a similar experience.

## üí° MS/PhD Basics
An MS degree typically covers advanced courses in your field (along with projects) and may or may not involve significant research work depending on whether it's a Thesis Master's degree or a Non-Thesis Master's degree. A thesis is a long document exposing original research work you did through your masters. 

In contrast to an MS program, a PhD curriculum typically includes coursework but places a greater emphasis on research. While an MS thesis may sometimes feel like a semester-long project, a PhD dissertation usually includes rigorous investigation into complex research questions, which can span more than two years. Moreover, in some regions it's necessary to hold an MS degree before considering a PhD.

It follows that the benefits we mentioned above apply to both MS and PhD degrees except that some of them are leveraged even more effectively with a PhD (e.g., PhD applicants would stand out even from MS applicants). Moreover, a PhD makes it possible to work as a professor (teaching) and advise other students in their MS/PhD journeys (research). This type of work (at a university) is often viewed to be more flexible than working in the industry for some research group.

## üá™üá¨ Graduate Studies at Cairo University
In this we focus on the MS program at our department (computer engineering).

### üìù Application Requirements
If you were among the top ten students in your class then you may be qualified to have your MS at our department for free. Offers are usually sent a year after you graduate (but you can request to start the MS before that), and go over higher ranking students first, and require you to be an internal teaching assistant as well.

In any case, you can apply as an ordinary student for MS regardless of your academic performance. Although MS at our department follows credit hours system, it's much less expensive (e.g., two years ago it was 25-30K).

In case you were not an undergrad at our department, you may be requested to cover prerequisite undergraduate courses before starting your MS.

Usually one can start applying a few weeks before the semester (and sometimes even after the semester starts). 
### ‚ú® Experience
To get your MS degree you must finish a number of courses equivalent to 21 credit hours (~10 courses) as well as defend a thesis which is worth 18 credit hours.
For the thesis, you would be working with one of the professors as your supervisor to do research in a field of interest; it's helpful if you reach out to professors you would like to work with in advance. 

You will be able to defend your thesis only if four semesters have passed since you started your MS. Thus, it takes two years or more.

### üè´ Courses & Summary

A list of the courses that you will choose from is [shown here](https://eng.cu.edu.eg/wp-content/uploads/PostGradSyllabus/23.htm). Not all courses are always available and most of those available are likely to be machine learning centered. The courses follow a similar nature as undergrad courses (and are taught by mostly the same professors that taught us as undergrads) but there is often much less focus on attendance (and classes take place much later). In some instances, a TA was able to start on their MS while being drafted in the military (taking advantage that attendance isn't emphasized).

Overall, the main distinction of the MS program from undergrad is the thesis requirement which can be quite challenging (but also quite rewarding if done right by opening opportunities for a PhD abroad). It's possible to pursue a PhD after finishing the MS at our department (more courses and a more demanding thesis). You become a faculty professor whether you finish your PhD in our department or abroad.

## üá™üá∫ Graduate Studies in Europe 
Another quite popular option is to pursue your graduate studies in Europe. We will focus on Germany here but other countries in Europe may share some similarities. One reason Germany is among the best places where you can have your MS is that it's only about 3.5 hours to Egypt (by airplane). Meanwhile, a ticket from Egypt to the U.S./Canada is often 15+ hours.

### üìÑ  Requirements

The requirements are as follows:

#### English certificate and transcript 
You easily request these from student affairs after graduation (or before for transcript). The transcript details all the courses you covered and your grades in them. You may need to submit extra material in case the transcript doesn't write the names of the chosen electives.


#### Proof of English proficiency 
Most of the time our college certificate is enough for that as it is stated that we studied in English; however, some programs require TOEFL or IELTS regardless of that. There is a plethora of online resources to prepare for taking either of these; however, IELTS is cheaper and handled more professionally in Egypt.

#### Two or three recommendation letters
Some universities require that the professor submit it himself/herself. Some require that the recommender is an academic recommender, and you can not get a recommendation from your team leader in your job and some are fine with non-academic recommendations.

#### Cover Letter
Always required and shows why you chose to pursue MS, why Germany and why this program.

#### Bachelor Thesis Book
May be submitted, no one cares if it is the group‚Äôs book or your individual book.

#### CV
Sometimes you are required to submit your resume.

#### Mailing
Some programs require that you send a copy of your documents via mail (ordinary mail not email) like Darmstadt university so you should apply early to make sure that your documents arrive before the deadline 

### üí° Finding Universities

You can check the different universities on [QS ranking website](https://www.topuniversities.com/university-subject-rankings/computer-science-information-systems?region=Europe&countries=de) and check their website. 

Some allow to apply through their website free of charge directly, and some required the application to be through a portal called [Uniassist](https://www.uni-assist.de/en/) which possibly requires your documents to be legalized through the German embassy and then sent to them and only after that you can apply through it. To understand more about Uniassist, consider [watching this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgoQOtt3dEc&t=823s) and for legalizing documents you can [watch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGAWbz30DDM&pp=ygUo2KrZiNir2YrZgiDYp9mE2LTZh9in2KfYr9iqINin2YXZhNmG2YrYpw%3D%3D).

In general, universities will give the most weight to your GPA and the extent to which the courses you covered align with those covered by undergraduates at the university.

### üí∏  Funding and Monthly Expenses
Now let's talk about the important stuff.
#### Cost of Education
Usually, most German master programs are almost free of charge (around ‚Ç¨200-‚Ç¨400 per semester).

However, for some regions like the one of Stuttgart or Freiburg it may cost ‚Ç¨1000-‚Ç¨2000 per semester. Lately a famous university like Technical University of Munich has become very expensive (more than ‚Ç¨4000 euros per semester) so it can vary, but yet free programs are very common and you should be able to find them.

#### Monthly Expenses Breakdown
‚Ç¨300-‚Ç¨500 + ‚Ç¨125 + ‚Ç¨200-‚Ç¨300 + ‚Ç¨0 for rent including all bills + health insurance + raw food + transport respectively. Transport is free for students and bills include water, gas and electricity.

You should enter the waiting list of college accommodation, but usually you wont get one and you should look for a room/apartment to rent yourself

#### Visa Necessary Condition
Being accepted at a university is not sufficient to get a visa and be able to pursue your studies in Germany. It will be necessary that you can show you will be able to *financially support yourself*. There are three possible ways for this:

I. Make what's known as a blocked account which has at least around ‚Ç¨11400 (this guarantees to Germany that you can support yourself for the next 12 months and after 12 months they may need to ensure this again by checking your balance).

II. Get a scholarship that clearly gives you at least around 1000 euros a month for 2 years. E.g., Search for DAAD scholarships, you can also book a free appointment with them and get a consultation session from their quarters in Zamalek.

III. Make someone in Germany demonstrate the ability of covering you financially (this may be risky for them so this option only makes sense if you have a close relative in Germany).

The most popular option is perhaps to make a blocked account and try to work during MS in Germany (part-time is allowed) so that you don't use much of that money. Understand more about blocked accounts by [watching this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9pzM-a-sOk&pp=ygUpZmludGliYSBibG9ja2VkIGFjY291bnQgbW9oYW1lZCBlbGJhc2lvbnk%3D).

For jobs, there is a special position ‚Äòworking student‚Äô you can search through Linkedin, XING, Stepstone.

####  ‚úÖ After MS
After your master's you are allowed to stay in Germany for 12 months to search for a job, if you get one you will change your stay from student to blue card. Alternatively, you can seek a PhD in Germany.

## üá∫üá∏ Graduate Studies in the United States
The U.S. follows a different system compared to Germany. To start off, the vast majority of MS opportunities in the U.S. are paid (and it's too expensive). Unless you get there via some external scholarship/fellowship such as [FullBright](https://fulbright-egypt.org/). For this reason, you will find that the most popular opportunity in the U.S. for Egyptian students is to get a PhD in the U.S.

PhDs in the U.S. usually take 4-6 years and have four special properties:

#### 1. Deadlines are too early 
For instance, to start in Fall (August) of 202X, you usually need to apply by at most 15th Dec. of 202Y where Y=X-1. This is the usual case but uncommonly, some universities support other starts not just fall (e.g., spring in January) or have more relaxed deadlines. In the U.S. many people find this to be fine because it gives them an opportunity to explore the industry more instead of moving from BS to PhD without industry experience.

#### 2. You need not have a MS degree to pursue it 
This is the normal case in the U.S. People that consider an MS usually consider it to be sufficient for them and don't consider a PhD. People who think they need a PhD go straight to it.

Moreover, many PhD programs are fine to award you with both a PhD and MS degree after your PhD if you fill some extra papers (without taking extra courses or doing extra research).

#### 3. They are almost always fully funded
That is, you pay nothing; in fact, you get paid (e.g., around $2K to $4K a month depending on the location and university). Usually the more expensive the area of the university is, the higher is a stipend.

In return, you either do research and teaching with your PhD supervisor or just research. In the first case, it's called a Teaching Assistanship and in the latter case, it's called a Research Assistanship. Teaching duties are usually not that significant compared to Egypt.

In summary, if you get accepted into a PhD program, you don't worry about funding because it will be covered.

#### 4. Universities care less about your GPA
In comparing different students, they rather look at research experience. Grades come after research experience and are mostly only relevant for the specific courses related to the field (e.g., they won't care about your grade networks and security if you're applying for a PhD in NLP). Meanwhile, universities that aren't as highly ranked may look more into the GPA because most of their applicants lack research experience.

#### How do you gain research experience?

The most ideal way is to participate in a research-focused internship. Student A has great research experience if, for example, they were able to publish a paper during their internship (or independently), the paper was published in a reputable journal, is being cited by other researchers, and the student's research supervisor provides excellent feedback on their work.

Research internships aren't that common in Egypt. However, they are extremely common in the U.S. (and more common in general). **Why?** Professors in the U.S. often have their own research groups and often need help in the summer with their research. To find them you can either search for "REU" (research as undergraduate) on Google or go to the faculty section in university websites and click on a professor and see if they write on their website that they are running a research internship for their research group. In some but not all cases they may be restricted to U.S. citizens.

Likewise, you may find research internships in gulf (khaleeji) countries.

### üìù Application Requirements

The requirements are as follows:

#### English certificate and transcript 
You easily request these from student affairs after graduation (or before for transcript). The transcript details all the courses you covered and your grades in them. You may need to submit extra material in case the transcript doesn't write the names of the chosen electives.

#### Proof of English proficiency 
Programs usually require TOEFL or IELTS (in some cases only TOEFL and in some cases they even accept Duolingo) and it's not so common for them to just accept that your BS was in English to waive this requirement. There is a plethora of online resources to prepare to taking either of these.

#### Three recommendation letters
Usually submitted by recommenders themselves to the portal (you write their email and they get instructions for how to do it). Usually can have at most one non-academic recommender (i.e., not a professor but rather a manager or something).

#### Research Statement/Statement of Purpose
Here you speak about why you are considering a PhD, what type of research interests you, your research experience (this is their favorite part) and the professors you will be happy to work with (i.e., be your mentor/supervisor(s)). Usually at most 1000 words.

#### Communication Diligence
This is not a formal requirement; however, it's common that you will reach out to professors to show your interest in being supervised by them for the PhD. It's a little risky to apply for a PhD and mention the name of professor X in your research statement without communicating with them or at least knowing whether they are willing to accept new students for the upcoming year (unless they mention in their personal page to not communicate).

#### Personal Statement
Some and not all universities like to look at your background and take it into account if you come from an underrepresented community or have a fascinating personal story that rhymes well with your interest in a PhD degree.

#### Application Fee
Usually expensive (e.g., $80) but it can be possible sometimes to request a fee waiver in the application website by informing them of your poor financial situation.

#### CV
Sometimes you are required to submit your resume.

### üí° Finding Universities

The right question to answer is actually finding professors. You have to carefully find a professor whose research interests you and who you think you can work under for 4-6 years. You can read online that many people regret not choosing the supervisor properly (e.g., by blindly just focusing on getting into the university).

To be more precise, it's alright to search by university, but make sure to choose the professor in the particular university well. To do this, go to [US News Ranking](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-engineering-schools/eng-rankings) and then go to the university website then look in the faculty section for professors. Each professor will have a personal page and many of them will write there that they are interested in new PhD students. Email those! But look at their work first and search up how to craft a proper email.

A faster approach for this is to visit [CSRanking](https://csrankings.org/#/index?all&us) which also ranks the professors in each university according to their research work.

### üí∏  Funding and Monthly Expenses
We clarified earlier that a monthly stipend is provided by the university. The monthly expenses depend on the area but the stipend will usually be enough and some little slack will usually be left off from it. At least one professor in our department has even mentioned they were able to live with their spouse with such stipend but the general consensus you will find online is that it can make you live with barely any luxuries.

#### ‚úÖ After PhD
Usually either get hired at a company to work on research (MAANG like to hire good PhDs) or get a postdoc position followed by a tenure-track (academic professor) position at some university (or go back to Egypt and consider opportunities there).

## üá®üá¶ Graduate Studies in Canada
Usually like Germany for MS and like the U.S. for PhD (but depends on university). We may refine this section later.
