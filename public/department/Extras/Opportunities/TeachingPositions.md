# 🧑🏻‍🏫 Teaching Assistant Opportunities

Special thanks to Dr. Dina Tantawy for her invaluable contribution in preparing the presentation that served as inspiration and reference for this work.

### Types of Teaching Roles
There are two types of employments for professors and TAs:

| Internal TA      | External TA      |
|------------------|------------------|
| Hired for topping their class (e.g., in top ten with preference to higher ranks) | Not required to top their class but at least be good enough for the selected course(s) |
| In parallel pursues a Master's degree in our department (funded by the department) | No need to pursue a Master's degree and will need to pay for it if considering that |
| Offers typically sent with ~1 year delay | Offers usually sent right away just before the semester |
| Can teach both mainstream and credit students | Can only teach credit students |
| Each tutorial taught is usually 1.5 hours (for mainstream)| Each tutorial taught is usually 3 hours (credit system) |
| Department usually seeking more internal TAs | Depends on the course; there can be many applicants/competition |
| Internal TAs must collectively cover all mainstream courses which may mean a lot per TA if there aren't many | External TAs are not required to teach a minimum number of courses (e.g., can teach one only) |

Similarly, an internal professor is an internal TA who has completed their PhD either in our department or abroad. External professors are not as common in the department but are occasionally hired to teach CS courses when there is a shortage of available internal professors.

### External TA Offers
A spreadsheet/form is usually sent to the representative of the class that has just graduated this year so that applicants can show their interest in being an external TA for one of the courses to be taught to credit students in the next semester. Representatives or students can reach out to the relevant professor in further years to request the spreadsheet/form.

### External TA Selection
Typically based on criteria such as your CV and more importantly your academic performance in the course you're applying for with a single exception: if an internal TA is interested in the same course then they get priority.

## 🤔 Why This Opportunity:
Although many people quickly shy away from considering this opportunity, there is more to it than meets the eye.
### 1. It's an Opportunity to Give Back to the Community
Similar to how some great TA was a major or great reason that you have learnt and became advanced in a certain subject you love, you can decide to become a TA to be the reason that other students learn and become advanced at a certain subject they love.

### 2. Be the Change You Want to See
You likely used to be not happy that tutorials in your favorite subject X lacked exposure to super interesting topic Y or presented topic Z in a way that was not as interesting as it could have been. Now you can change that to make a positive difference in the experience of the upcoming students!

### 3. Acquire a Deeper Understanding of the Subject
In other words, it's an excellent opportunity to peak at the learning curve of a subject you are interested in. Previously, the only reason was to empower you and now it also involves empowering tens of others. 

Moreover, it's widely known (as in the Feynman technique) that teaching uncovers gaps or incorrect understanding in your knowledge that could have been left unresolved otherwise and the proper resolution to resolve these gaps is often to deepen your understanding.

### 4. Shines on Your Resume
Suppose you apply to work at company X in field Y which you taught as a TA. First, being a TA which implies a deeper understanding will give you an edge (in that dimension) over most other applications and second, you will probably do pretty well in the technical interview as a result of such a deep understanding (e.g., by providing more elaborate and sophisticated answers). 

Don't forget that by this, you are also a TA at the #1 university in Egypt.

### 5. Enhance Your Soft Skills and Gain More
You can easily derive that you will learn to be better at skills such as communication, explanation, time management, conflict resolution and more as a result of such experience. It's also a great networking opportunity (with professors and students also graduating soon).

### 6. It's a Fulfilling Job
With every tutorial, you feel fulfilled (i.e., happy and rewarding) that you were able to make a positive impact on other people by delivering the tutorial.

### 7. Thawab
روي مسلم

| عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ رضي الله تعالى عنه: أَنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ ﷺ قَالَ: إِذَا مَاتَ ابنُ آدم انْقَطَعَ عَنْهُ عَمَلُهُ إِلَّا مِنْ ثَلَاثٍ: صَدَقَةٍ جَارِيَةٍ، أو عِلْمٍ يُنْتَفَعُ بِهِ، أَوْ وَلَدٍ صَالِحٍ يَدْعُو لَهُ |

### 8. You Are Important
If you think about it, there are many reasons why you are important and special for this role. Among these are that you have a **first hand on the technology**, you have **been there as a student** and know the challenges, you are **closer in age** to your students so they can better understand you and you are likely packed with **enthusiasm** and the **top** of your class.

### 9. Your Impact Will be Remembered
*"Everyone who remembers his own education remembers teachers, not methods and techniques. The teacher is the heart of the educational system."* –Sidney Hook

### 10. You Get Paid
Even if the figures are not that big, they are not far off from other entry-level software jobs in the fields, if the same number of hours is given and assuming some prior knowledge of the courses.

## 👮🏻 Duties as a Teaching Assistant
In particular, you need to fulfill seven major duties as a teaching assistant:
- Attend meetings with your course instructor and follow their instructions

- Attend all Tutorials and an exam proctoring for each course

- Prepare and Explain labs/sheets/tutorial material (as required )

- Grade labs/assignments/Project/..etc.
 
 - Take attendance.

- Provide office hours and respond to student inquiries in timely manner

- Respect towards everyone.

It is important to note that the frequency of meetings and your autonomy as a TA will depend on the course and the instructor. Typically, frequent meetings are not necessary; a meeting at the beginning of the course to set up the basics is often sufficient, with additional meetings held only when needed. Generally, there is a decent amount of autonomy.

## ⚖️ Rights as a Teaching Assistant
Your default rights as a TA are as follows:
| Salary | Respect | Lab assistance | Request maintenance of infrastructure | Provide Suggestions & Feedback | Get Feedback |
|--------|---------|----------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------|

Moreover, you may request an academic email during your career as a TA and an experience certificate after you finish.

⭐ That's it! We hope you contribute in making a positive difference for other by considering being a TA at a subject you love and would be good to teach.
