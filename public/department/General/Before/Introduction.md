# ‚õ© Introduction

The purpose of this section of cmp-docs is to make you aware of all that you need to know in order to informatively decide whether or not to enroll in this department. After all, the most rational thing to do before making a decision is collecting more information. Every day, a significant percentage of people make bad decisions just because they didn't or couldn't communicate to know more. You're not one of those today, hopefully.

## üéü Tour Details

Here we will start by giving you an introduction to computer engineering, taking into account what you already know from the preparatory year. We will then continue by diving into the different fields that you could be working after graduating from the department followed by how our department (computer engineering) is different from other engineering departments with respect to the content covered and the fields. Lastly, we will mention the major benefits of being a computer engineer and top off with a set of frequently asked questions and their answers; a section that can be welcomely expanded by your own questions once you make an issue for them on the [Github repository](https://github.com/EssamWisam/cmp-docs/issues).

## üõ• From Engineering to Computer Engineering

Most if not all definitions of engineering you will find in dictionaries or elsewhere will agree that is is about *"designing, building, and maintaining items by applying science*. The items involved depend on the engineering fields; for instance, in civil and architectural engineering, the items are buildings, bridges, tunnels, and other structures. In electrical engineering, the items are usually high-voltage electrical devices such as transformers, motors, and generators. For aerospace engineering its aeroplanes and aircraft in general. Meanwhile, electronics and communication engineering applies it on electronics and communication devices (e.g., radio).

The items for computer engineering are, as you have guessed, computers. This doesn't just involve the computer itself as a piece of hardware (electronics) but also software (programs) that runs on the computer; this is one aspect of computer engineering that sets it apart from electronics engineering and software engineering; both of which only focus on hardware or software.

To further reassert, the association for computer machinery (ACM) defines it precisely as *"the discipline that embodies the science and technology of design, construction, implementation, and maintenance of software and hardware components of modern computing systems and computer-controlled equipment."*

Although computer engineering is defined to consider both the software and the hardware; the definition does not set thresholds on either; perhaps, you may find yourself doing much more software than hardware in this department which is fair because of how broad the latter is. Another thing that is worthy to note, and which may seem like a plot twist to you, is that even hardware is designed via software. That is, one writes code to design hardware via a programming language to describe the connections and interactions of an electronic chip such as a processor. A fabrication lab has machines that can convert a result of that software description into hardware itself by growing and connecting transistors on the chip. Lead is used for connections and Silicon is the core material of the transistor; sand is silicon dioxide; hence, the meme.

## üë®üèª‚Äçüè´ The Preparatory Year

One of the incredible facets of the preparatory year is that it offers a taste of each engineering department by exposing students to one or more courses from each department. You will find that you have covered courses related to civil, architectural, chemical, electrical, mechanical, and computer engineering in the preparatory year. In reality, however, the programming course you covered in the prep year may be viewed as not representative of what you will really do once you join the department. Much more emphasis will be on actual practice, and *typically not in the form* of simulating the computer on paper by tracing nested for loops or generating a pattern of asterisks.

In essence, the purpose of this segment is to let you know that you, perhaps, should not judge your fitness to the department by the amount of likeliness you had towards the programming course taught in the prep year. They can be viewed as very different forms of learning experience.
