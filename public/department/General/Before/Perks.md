# ðŸ¤© Perks & Benefits of Joining

**I. There is no or little fog; projects simulate actual future career.**

You won't be asking yourself "so what will I be doing after I graduate" because the experience is very much like what you did in your college projects; solving a problem by coding as a team. There is more or less a team project for every single computer engineering course you will cover in the department. Refer to the courses section to know more.

**II. A free portfolio on-the-go, a corollary of the previous point.**

The sheer amount of projects you will work on may all be helpful for your portfolio and many of which may be impressive to recruiters.

**III. Room for creativity, research and many other personas.**

Unlike other fields, this one is too broad. Thus, it doesn't have extremely strict requirements on what skills you have, only subfields within may do. For instance, suppose it's true that architectural engineering benefits immensely from creativity and communication engineering benefits immensely from mathematics. In computer engineering, you will find niches that are benefited from the former (e.g., front-end web development) and the latter (e.g., machine learning) and other fields that require different compositions. It's not just narrowed down to one thing.

**IV. Remote jobs are very standard.**

It turns out that thanks to the internet, you can work as a team on a project from anywhere. Unlike other engineering fields, remote jobs (i.e., working from home) are a classic. It's not that a lot of people would like just working from home since this is better for their productivity, it's also that it opens up many more opportunities like working abroad because distance is not an issue.

**V. Salaries are more than good**

For the most part, rookie salaries even as a fresh grad are not part of the equation for computer engineering and computer science majors. The rationale being that programs developed by these individuals often mean a lot for a business in terms of their financial growth and there is a lot of demand on them. Here in Egypt, a classic starting salary for a job with humble requirements and that seeks graduates from this particular university may be as high as 16K a month.

**VI. Gives you self-sufficiency in the business world**

Business people need you. They will often seek a lot of investment just to hire software engineers to work on their idea. As a software engineer, if you have your own idea you are self-sufficient to implement it yourself!

**VII. Competitions**

If you like competing then you will find much of that in this department. Competitions can help open up opportunities for you and often involve networking and reward benefits. Writing problem solving algorithms and machine learning are two main areas that involve a lot of competitions.

**VIII. You are just 80 people**

Everyone gets to know everyone else and perhaps also work with them. Such a network is often much stronger than those formed in other departments with much more people.
