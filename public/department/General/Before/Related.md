# 🤝🏻 Related Departments

In this article, we will highlight the differences between computer engineering and other engineering departments such as communication and electronics engineering, biomedical engineering and even computer science as a different major. In all cases, as should be implicitly guessed, we consider the departments under the curricula used to teach them here, at Cairo university. A superscript attached to a fact implies that a reasonable proof or source for it exists and can be provided upon request in a Github issue.

## 💻 Computer Science

- Computer science graduates are legitimate "software engineers" both in Egypt and worldwide. Thus, they are also part of this industry.

- As theoretically defined in the introduction, computer engineering extends software engineering by adding emphasis on hardware.

- This does translate to the practical distinction that there are more hardware projects where hardware is actually involved in the computer engineering department than the computer science department.

- More generally, projects and coursework are taken much more seriously and occur more often in the computer engineering department.¹

- As a result, it can be easier to build a strong portfolio by majoring in computer engineering than in computer science. It is possible, however, that a computer science uses the fact above by using more free time to work on their own projects.

## 📡 Communication & Electronics Engineering

- Much farther away from software than computer engineers as it puts much more emphasis on hardware and theory.

- Unlike computer engineering, most of the hardware emphasis goes to analog electronics (e.g., radio) rather than digital electronics (e.g., computers).

- Almost no or very week intersection regarding the first two fields (software engineering and machine learning).

- Significant intersection when it comes to digital design, embedded systems and networks.


## 🧬 Biomedical Engineering

- Reasonable intersection in the first two fields (software engineering and machine learning) but with less focus in return of more biomedical engineering.
