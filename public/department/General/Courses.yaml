      description: The essence of this set of courses is to teach you all you need to
        know about programming in general. Although C++ will be used to apply
        much of what you will learn here, you will find that it generalizes well
        to all other languages you will learn later.

                    Kirchhoff's current and voltage laws, etc. The rest of the course explores other methods to solve circuits
                    such as Y-Delta Transformations which simplifies the circuit by solving an equivalent one,  Loop Analysis and Node Analysis 
                    which are methods that could be derived from Kirchhof's laws to solve circuits. Other interesting and more advanced methods of solving circuits such as Superposition theorem
                    and Thevenin/Norton's theorem are also explained. The course tops off by explaining AC circuits involving capacitors and inductors with more mathematical
                    rigour compared to high school.

                    ### Course Content: 
                    \n The course majorly generalizes many electromagnetism concepts covered in the preparatory year to higher dimensions (surfaces). It starts by recapping on the needed solid geometry while vector calculus explanations
                    will often be accompanied with lectures that needed. Among the concepts covered are Coulomb‚Äô Law, Continuous Charge Distributions, Electrostatic potential for charges and surfaces, polarization and dielectrics as well
                    as Faraday's and Ampere's laws, and Maxwell's equations for electrodynamics. The course is somewhat intensive due to the vector calculus involved.

                    The modern physics part of the course is smaller and considers concepts such as black body radiation and photon energy. Dealing with equations here is just as easy as plugging numbers.

                    using the small signal model. This is followed by methods using transistors to generate a specific current in a circuit such as current mirrors and supply independent
                    biasing. The second half or so of the course focuses execlusively in using the MOS transistor to create various types of amplifiers (common-source, common-drain,
                    differential, operational, etc.) You will learn that amplifiers can be used for much more than just amplifying voltage; they can take the derivative or integrate and incoming signal!

                    by focusing more on the digital applications. Factors such as delay, power and noise will be analyzed as well as new/different methods to form logical circuits using MOS transistors. 
                    The applications for logical circuits also go beyond combinational circuits to include sequential circuits which allows the course to also include more digital applications 
                    for transistors such as DRAM and SRAM memories and digital/analog conversion.

                    \n A signal is simply a function in time that represents some physical quantity (e.g., voice or transmitted internet data). The course starts by exploring operations that could be done
                    on signals (e.g., shifting) and how their power and energy could be mathematically measured. It follows that by considering systems and their properties, which are mathematical transformations
                    of signals. It then zooms in at a specific type of systems: linear time-invariant systems, which are abundant and have nice properties that allow them to be described using the convolution mathematical
                    operation which is also explained. The course continues by exposing the fact that any signal as a function in time corresponds as well to another function in frequency (dual variable) and that
                    mathematics in the frequency domain could be much easier to deal with. The last part of the course repeats the concepts but for discrete instead of continuous signals while showing that any continuous signal
                    could be also possibly perfectly described as a discrete one! This is important because all electronics deal only with digital signals (operate through a clock).

                    ### Course Content: 
                    \n This course uses signals knowledge to develop devices that help in transmitting and receiving electromagnetic waves without needing extremely tall antennas and while
                    efficiently using the medium where the signals are flowing without having them interfere with each other. The technique that solves these problems is called modulation
                    and the focus of the course is to convey why it works and its different types (amplitude, frequency and phase) modulation and how different modulators/demodulators can
                    be designed. Modulation system designs considered include: DSB-SC, DSB-LC, QAM, SSB and more.

                    \n Dr. Mai and Dr. Hala   \n

                    \n Signals Course \n
                    ### Course Content: 
                    \n The course is composed of two main parts that each attempt to send more digital data while being robust to noise. 
                    The first part taught by Dr. Mai approaches
                    the problem by designing a better digital system using filters which also involves intermediate mathematics; meanwhile, the part by Dr. Hala approaches the problem by
                    representing the digital data itself in a better way (e.g., adding parity bits) and involves more basic mathematics and concepts. Lectures usually alternate between both professors.
                    \n
                    Dr. Mai's part involves concepts such as converting the digital data into signals and vice versa, mathematically modeling noise as a random process, designing an optimal filter to
                    minimize such noise and then extending it to deal with intersymbol interference (the signal overlapping with itself due to properties of the medium) and to generalize it to discrete
                    settings with more than two symbols (beyond binary). Her part tops off with modulation techniques for digital signals.
                    \n
                    Dr. Hala's part starts with important concepts such as entropy and how it relates to probability along with other basic concepts and then proceeds by exploring different methods
                    to detect and correct errors in a received signal.
                    \n
                    ### Project: 
                    \n There is no project but expect programming assignments (Python) to implement concepts from the first part of the course.  \n

                    \n Signals and Systems (and Differential Equations) \n
                    ### Course Content: 
                    \n The course consists of two main parts. The first, taught by Dr. Ragia, is about describing systems (e.g., a mechanical system of springs or an electrical circuit) by
                    differential equations and then converting this representation into a form that allows easy analysis of various charactheristics of the system such as stability and speed as well as
                    modifying or adding mathematically-defined components to the system to make it meet particular system charachteristics (e.g., make it a stable or faster system). \n
                    On the other hand, Dr. Mohamed's part focuses on automatic systems whose behaviour could be specified with simple programming code (called PLC systems). This part barely involves any mathematics
                    and is mostly about programming the PLC system to achieve a particular behaviour.
                    \n
                    ### Project:
