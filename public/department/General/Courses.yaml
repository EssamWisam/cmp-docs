      description: The essence of this set of courses is to teach you all you need to
        know about programming in general. Although C++ will be used to apply
        much of what you will learn here, you will find that it generalizes well
        to all other languages you will learn later.

                    programming using C++. After the course you will have familiarity with major OOP concepts such as classes, objects,
                    inheritance, polymorphism and more. Concepts learnt in this course also generalize to other programming languages that
                    support the object-oriented paradigm. \n
