This is a proposal for a communication channels scheme that your class can follow. It has been employed by the 2023 class and perhaps also partly by other classes. The components are as follows


**âœ¦ One WhatsApp Group for Discussions**

This group would be restricted to discussions between students whether regarding course material or not. 

**âœ¦ One WhatsApp Group for Materials**

Materials prepared by other students can be shared in this group or announcements that official material by professors have been uploaded to Google drive. Limited people such as the representative, academic teams director and strong volunteers should have admin access to this group.

**âœ¦ One WhatsApp Group for Announcements**

This group is primarily used by the representative to make announcements. Example announcements are deadline changes, forwarded messages or emails from professors, event information and organization details, changes in the schedule, polls and forms to collect opinion and make collective decisions, etc. The existence of this group limits what the Facebook group can be used for and that's okay because not everyone has a Facebook or likes to be active on that platform.

**âœ¦ One WhatsApp Group for Opportunities**

This group is created later on when students from the class are qualified to start looking for internships and other opportunities. These can be shared for the whole class here. The group is typically managed by a volunteer who is willing to stay on the watch for internships and opportunities and share them and the representative can assist in that.

**âœ¦ One WhatsApp Community to Combine All Department-related Groups**

Groups such as the above and others that have to do with the class should be under the same community to allow ease of access. Note that the announcements group comes as the community is created by default.

**âœ¦ One WhatsApp Group for the Team Leaders**

All team leaders and the representative form a group to discuss anything related to academics in the class.

**âœ¦ One Group for each Academic Team**

The team leader for each academic team and the rest of the team form their own group to manage the material and Google drive for that course.

**âœ¦ One Discord Server for the Class**

The idea is that it would be nice if there was a separate group for discussions in each course; however, if this is done WhatsApp may feel messy with the excessive number of groups and some of them will be inactive for long periods, other active ones may be too spammy. Hence, a better idea is to create a Discord server for the whole class with a channel (group) for each course. Notifications in discord are less spammy than WhatsApp and voice channels can be added so students can discuss course content by voice call or presenting screen.
