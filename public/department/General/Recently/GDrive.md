# ðŸ“‚ Google Drive

The representative or academic teams director creates a shared folder using their university gmail to include all coursework material for all courses taught throughout the four years. The folder should be shared so that anyone can view it and add comments. Only team leaders get write access to their course's folder.

A shortened link for the Google drive should be available in the description of the materials group. That folder has a folder for each year of the four and for each year there are two folders, one for each semester. The folder for the semester could at least consist of a folder for each course, calendar and emails document. Any deadlines should be present on that calendar and the emails document should have the emails of all professors and TAs.

The folder structure is a bit different in the credit hours system (credit) drive folders. As the credit system is not organized by years but rather individual courses, our drive is organized by the courses codes.
You will find a folder for each course prefix (CMP, ELC/EEC, MTH, ...) and inside it you will find the folder for each course. We also add shortcuts for the drive of previous years in each folder to be easier to check previous materials. Here is an [example](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uF3G7gS4oPPCkv-DOftxdAset5fE3_cw?usp=drive_link) for the files structure.


Meanwhile, the folder under each course can take many forms. This link is an [example](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1xX7i8WfnxVCHv1sH6U5smRfJek846hgB) of what a course folder can look like. Notice the progress document file. No one should need to ask "What did we cover in lecture xyz?"

The following is a table containing the drive links of some of the previous and current classes:

More links to Google drives of all previous years shall be added here later.

Some classes have created a youtube channel to upload various video resources such as recorded lectures and tutorials. Others preferred to upload them to the gdrive.
