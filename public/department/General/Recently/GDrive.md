# ðŸ“‚ Google Drive

The representative or academic teams director creates a shared folder using their university gmail to include all coursework material for all courses taught throughout the four years. The folder should be shared so that anyone can view it and add comments. Only team leaders get write access to their course's folder.

A shortened link for the Google drive should be available in the description of the materials group. That folder has a folder for each year of the four and for each year there are two folders, one for each semester. The folder for the semester could at least consist of a folder for each course, calendar and emails document. Any deadlines should be present on that calendar and the emails document should have the emails of all professors and TAs.

Meanwhile, the folder under each course can take many forms. This link is an [example](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1xX7i8WfnxVCHv1sH6U5smRfJek846hgB) of what a course folder can look like. Notice the progress document file. No one should need to ask "What did we cover in lecture xyz?"

The following is a table containing the drive links of some of the previous and current classes:
