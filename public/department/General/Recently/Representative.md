# ðŸ‘¥ Representative & Teams

![image](https://i.gifer.com/4APT.gif)

In this section we will talk about the typical organizational structure of a class. Any member of the class can take one of the following roles 

**âž² Ordinary Student**

Just a normal student that doesn't often contribute and isn't part of an academic team. This is usually a negligible count as all students are often contributing, even if on small scales regarding the number of students reached or the size of the work.


**âž² Contributing Student**

Likes to share their efforts towards a course or more to help others. They may not be part of the course's academic team because they like to work at their own pace.

**âž² Team Member**

Contributing students that are ready to collaborate in a course at a steady pace. For instance, writing detailed lectures or study notes every week.

**âž² Team Leader**

Is like a team member but is also responsible for the team's progress (administers the team's group) and more importantly managing the course's Google drive (they have direct modification access on the folder). Exceptional team leaders and/or teams will devote their time prior to the exam to answer other students' questions whether via chat or voice channels on Discord.

**âž² Academic Teams Director**

One of the team leaders can volunteer for this role or be selected through a vote. The additional responsibilities are periodically checking the Google drive and the progress from all teams and also importantly, managing the materials group.

**âž² Representative**

Every year students vote for a representative for the class. The representative is the coupling link between class and professors, outsiders (e.g., companies) and faculty overall.

Thus, the three major duties are communicating with professors and the class, communicating with the outside world, organizing and planning events. Here are some personal qualities that make a good representative along with a justification of each.


| Personal Quality | Rationale |
|------------------|----------|
| Is ready to devote their own time to fulfill their duty.        | Being a representative can consume a lot of time and effort whether while communicating with professors (e.g., email or call) or while announcing the information to colleagues (may take careful explanation) and hearing back from them. Things like organizing events can even further diverge in time but are usually only a problem in later years.  |
| Is online and is interruptible.          | You may decide to study for the next number of hours only to receive an email or call from a professor that you will need to immediately announce; sometimes you may need to further discuss the email with the professor before announcing which will also take time and sometimes you may need to also further react after getting feedback from your colleagues. Unfavorable consequences occur when announcements are not delivered on time. On another note, any student may reach out to you any time to ask about more details about xyz, and it may matter to them to know about it as soon as possible and you may need to first check with the TA or professor for that. |
| Is proactive.     | E.g., anticipates issues and takes action towards them before they occur. If colleagues will probably not be happy to hear an announcement (e.g., a deadline), then you may rationally convince your professor why that would be the case so the issue is solved before it occurs. |
| Is ready to negotiate all the time.       | Assigned class work from course x does not often consider course work from course y. A lack of negotiation when rationally needed may leave your class with early colliding deadlines and midterms that span enormous content, and larger project/assignment scopes than can be sustained. |
| Communicates effectively and clearly.       | Even if your argument is rational, communicating it in the wrong way may lead to more adverse results. This also involves writing good emails or saying the right thing in a call and writing clear announcements any one can understand. |
| Familiarity with Excel or Google sheets.       | Creating spreadsheets for project and assignment teams will be a periodic reality. It's often good to prepare an initial set of sheets so project teams can form whenever the project is announced, or before if your class likes it. |
| Familiarity with Google or Microsoft forms.    |Besides WhatsApp polls, you may need to create forms to collect more information from students as required by one of the professors or TAs. |
|Has search and bargaining skills.         | This is useful while organizing events or similar and money is involved. Your class should pay the lowest amount of money in return of the highest quality. |
| Always aims to make the class feel as comfortable as possible.       | Representative Basics. |
